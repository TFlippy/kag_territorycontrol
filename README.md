## Rules for contributing
- Be friendly and open for a discussion.
- No name calling or trying to attack one another.
- Do not gate-keep suggestions/ideas just because one user does not play as much as you, or has different views.
- Do not expect professionalism 24/7 from people who contribute in their free time while getting nothing in return. 

## How to contribute issues
Issue's can cover a wide range of stuff, for example:
- Bug reports
- Suggestions for new content
- Enchantments to existing content
When making a new issue, try keep it clear and concise. We do not mind having multiple issues, it's preferable over 1 issue containing many bugs.

When making bug reports, please include images or videos where you think it may be helpful. Log's are not needed, we will ask for them when it's required. 


## How to contribute code changes
There is a type of 'DRM', but it's extremely basic and designed to stop kids from re-hosting.
If you any amount of programming knowledge, you can find a way to bypass it. Make sure you do not include it in a Pull request.

With that out the way:
- Talk to the community about what you plan to change and why
- Keep code style consistent <a href="https://github.com/transhumandesign/kag-base/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">(Check this out for KAG's coding style)</a>
- Any PR should focus on one thing, and only that thing
- Every PR should include a change list (this makes it easier for us to review & make a change log)

When filling out the description, include the following things:

```
# What does this PR accomplish/add to the game

# What would you like written in the change log for this PR

[Y/N] - Have I tested it out in localhost
[Y/N] - Have I tested it out in a dedicated server
```
